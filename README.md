# Fun project

Wanted to add all of the shorts that automatically update when the creator uploads a new short. Currently having issues distinguishing shorts from regular videos that are short in duration.

# Want to run yourself?

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create an account if you don't already have one. 
2. Create a project.
3. Add the YouTube Data API v3 API to your project.
4. Generate an API key.
5. Clone this repo.
6. Update API key in your own project.

I ran this with VS Code addon called Live Server.
